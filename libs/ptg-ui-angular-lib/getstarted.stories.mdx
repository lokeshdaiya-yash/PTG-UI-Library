Before the installation we have to do some steps : 


Step 1 - Open the .npmrc file from the below path :

`C:\Users\prathmesh.bhosale\.npmrc`




Step 2 - We need to replace the code from the below given code :
```
@ptg-ui:registry=https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/YASHTech-UIUX/YASH-UIUX-Library/_packaging/UI-packages/npm/registry/

//pkgs.dev.azure.com/YASHTech-UIUX/YASH-UIUX-Library/_packaging/UI-packages/npm/registry/:username=VssSessionToken

; This is an unencrypted authentication token. Treat it like a password. DO NOT share this value with anyone, including Microsoft support.

//pkgs.dev.azure.com/YASHTech-UIUX/YASH-UIUX-Library/_packaging/UI-packages/npm/registry/:_password=aHNhaG9tamdwaGEzYjJjYWdzZWF3NnRjZHRyamY0amtzZmdyZzZ1dHR3YWlkNWFzNzJuYQ==

; The npm client won't use username and _password without an email set, but the service doesn't use the email value. The following is an arbitrarily made-up address.

//pkgs.dev.azure.com/YASHTech-UIUX/YASH-UIUX-Library/_packaging/UI-packages/npm/registry/:email=not-used@example.com
```




Step 3 - Open the cmd and run the following command : 

```
vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc
```

After that it will ask for the username and password once it is done we get the authentication mail from the npm.



Step 4 -  Now we have to install the library so that we have to run the following command :

```
npm install @ptg-ui/angular --save
```



Step 5 - Once the installation is completed we have to just import the elements from the library.

 `import {  } from ' @ptg-ui/angular'`
