 # Calender Component

 ---


The ngx-bootstrap library provides a bs-datepicker component with many configuration options that you can use to 
customize the calendar view in your Angular application.

Date pickers are commonly used in web apps for choosing dates.

Dates can be selected by navigating between various dates using UI.


```
import { CalendarModule } from '@ptg-ui/angular'

```

Types of controls supported by calendar:

 - className
 - id
 - isDisable
 - placeholder


## Quick Start
 
1] className :

The HTML className attribute is used to specify a className for an HTML element.

The className attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by a other languages to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name.

Multiple HTML elements can share the same class.

<Canvas><Story id="component-calendarcomponent--class-name" /></Canvas>


2] id :

The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document.

The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by other languages to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.

The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.


<Canvas><Story id="component-calendarcomponent--id" /></Canvas>


3] is Disable : 

The disabled property sets or returns whether a calendar is disabled, or not.

A disabled element is unusable and un-clickable. Disabled elements are usually rendered in gray by default in browsers.

true - The calendar is disabled

false - Default. The calendar is not disabled


<Canvas><Story id="component-calendarcomponent--is-disabled" /></Canvas>


4] placeholder : 

The placeholder attribute specifies a short hint that describes the expected value of an input field (e.g. a sample value or a short description of the expected format).

The short hint is displayed in the input field before the user enters a value.

Note: The placeholder attribute works with the following input types: text, search, url, tel, email, and password.

<Canvas><Story id="component-calendarcomponent--placeholder" /></Canvas>
