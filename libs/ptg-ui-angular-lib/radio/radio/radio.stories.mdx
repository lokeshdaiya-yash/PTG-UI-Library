# Radio Component

---

Radio component are used when a list of two or more options are mutually exclusive, meaning the user must select only one.

We can import the radio tag using the following importation :

```
    import { RadioModule } from ' @ptg-ui/angular'
```

Types of controls supported by Radio:

- id
- item

## Quick Start

we can create a radio using the following HTML Tag:

```
<ptg-ui-radio id="ptg-radio" [items]="items"></ptg-ui-radio>

```

Following are some controls with their explanation :

1] id :

The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document.

The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by other languages to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.

The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.

2] items :

We can use it to change the properties of radio button. For ex. if we want to change the name of radio button we can access or change it as items.name.
