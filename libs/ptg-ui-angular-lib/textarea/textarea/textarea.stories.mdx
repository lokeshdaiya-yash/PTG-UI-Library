 # Textarea Component

 ---

The `<textarea>` tag defines a multi-line text input control.

The `<textarea>` element is often used in a form, to collect user inputs like comments or reviews.

A text area can hold an unlimited number of characters, and the text renders in a fixed-width font (usually Courier).


We can import the textarea tag using the following importation : 

```
    import { TextareaModule } from ' @ptg-ui/angular'
```    


 ## Quick Start
 
 we can create a textarea using the following HTML Tag: 


```

<textarea #textarea 
[placeholder]="placeholder"
[class]="className"
[id]="id"
[(ngModel)]="textareaValue"
[value]="value"
[attr.aria-placeholder] = "aria_placeholder"
(input)="onchangeInput($event.target)"
(blur)="onBlur()"></textarea>

```


 Following a are some controls with their values :

 1] placeholder :

The placeholder attribute specifies a short hint that describes the expected value of an input field (e.g. a sample value or a short description of the expected format).

The short hint is displayed in the input field before the user enters a value.

Note: The placeholder attribute works with the following input types: text, search, url, tel, email, and password.

 2] id : 


The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document.

The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.

The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.


<Canvas><Story id="component-textareacomponent--id" /></Canvas>   


 3] class :

The HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element.

The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by a JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name.

Multiple HTML elements can share the same class.

<Canvas><Story id="component-textareacomponent--class-name" /></Canvas>



4]  value :


The value attribute specifies the value of an  element.

The value attribute is used differently for different input types:

For "button", "reset", and "submit" - it defines the text on the button
For "text", "password", and "hidden" - it defines the initial (default) value of the input field
For "checkbox", "radio", "image" - it defines the value associated with the input (this is also the value that is sent on submit)
