 # Input Component

 ---

The HTML input element is primarily to create HTML forms. In other words, an HTML `<input>` tag is used to create the data fields on forms that enable users to enter information. 

We can import the input tag using the following importation : 

```
    import { InputModule } from ' @ptg-ui/angular'
```    

Types of controls supported by input:

 - placeholder
 - id
 - class
 - type
 - value




 ## Quick Start
 
 we can create a input using the following HTML Tag: 


```
<input
  #input  
  [placeholder]="placeholder"
  [class]="className"
  [type]="type"
  [id]="id"
  [(ngModel)]="inputValue"
  [value]="value"
  [attr.aria-placeholder] = "aria_placeholder"
  (input)="onchangeInput($event.target)"
  (blur)="onBlur()"
/>

```


 Following a are some controls with their values :

 1] placeholder :

The placeholder attribute specifies a short hint that describes the expected value of an input field (e.g. a sample value or a short description of the expected format).

The short hint is displayed in the input field before the user enters a value.

Note: The placeholder attribute works with the following input types: text, search, url, tel, email, and password.

<Canvas><Story id="component-inputcomponent--placeholder" /></Canvas>


 2] id : 


The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document.

The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by other languages and manipulate the element with the specific id.

The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.


<Canvas><Story id="component-inputcomponent--id" /></Canvas>   


 3] class :

The HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element.

The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by a other languages and manipulate elements with the specific class name.

Multiple HTML elements can share the same class.

<Canvas><Story id="component-inputcomponent--class" /></Canvas>


 4] type :

The type attribute specifies the type of  element to display.

If the type attribute is not specified, the default type is "text".

`<input type="text">` defines a single-line text input field:

<Canvas><Story id="component-inputcomponent--type" /></Canvas>


5]  value :


The value attribute specifies the value of an  element.

The value attribute is used differently for different input types:

For "button", "reset", and "submit" - it defines the text on the button
For "text", "password", and "hidden" - it defines the initial (default) value of the input field
For "checkbox", "radio", "image" - it defines the value associated with the input (this is also the value that is sent on submit)


<Canvas><Story id="component-inputcomponent--value" /></Canvas>
