 # Select Component

 ---
You can use the select tag to create drop-down menus so that users can select the value they want.

The multiple attribute on a select tag specifies that multiple items can be selected.


 We can import the select tag using the following importation : 

```
    import { SelectModule } from ' @ptg-ui/angular'
```    

 Types of controls supported by select component:

 - id
 - placeholder
 - bindLabel
 - isMultiple
 - closeOnSelect
 - itemCount



 ## Quick Start
 
 we can create a select using the following HTML Tag: 


```
<ptg-ui-select
  id=""
  placeholder=""
  [items]="items"
  bindLabel=""
  [isMultiple]="true"
  [closeOnSelect]="true"
  [itemCount]="3"
></ptg-ui-select>

```


 Following are some controls with their explanation :

 1] id : 

 
The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document.

The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by other languages and manipulate the element with the specific id.

The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.
