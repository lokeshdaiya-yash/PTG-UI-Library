 # Accordian Component
 
 ---

 The  accordion is a component that organizes content within collapsable items. 
 
 Accordion allows the display of only one collapsed item at a time.


 
 We can import the accordion tag using the following importation : 

```
    import { AccordianModule } from ' @ptg-ui/angular'
```    

 Types of controls supported by button:

 - isAnimated
 - isDisabled
 - oneAtATime



 ## Quick Start
 
 we can create a accordian using the following HTML Tag: 


```
<ptg-ui-accordian
  [listData]="listData"
  [isAnimated]="false"
  [isDisabled]="false"
  [oneAtATime]="false"
></ptg-ui-accordian>
```


 Following are some controls with their explanation :

 1] isAnimated :

 isAnimated control is used to transform the element. 

 This property allows you to rotate the elements.


<Canvas><Story id="component-accordiancomponent--is-animated" /></Canvas>


 2] isDisable :

 The disabled property sets or returns whether a button is disabled, or not.

 A disabled element is unusable and un-clickable. Disabled elements are usually rendered in gray by default in browsers.

 true - The button is disabled

 false - Default. The button is not disabled
   

<Canvas><Story id="component-accordiancomponent--is-disabled" /></Canvas>   


3] oneAtATime :

We can use oneAtATime control to show only one element at time.

<Canvas><Story id="component-accordiancomponent--one-at-a-time" /></Canvas>
