 # High3DLineChart Component

 ---

This chart is created using the Highcharts library. Highcharts provides a wide variety of charts.   

A line graph is a graphical representation of information that changes over a period of time.

You can plot it by using several points linked by straight lines. It comprises two axes called the “x-axis” and the “y-axis“.


We can import the LineChart  using the following importation : 
```
    import { ChartModule } from ' @ptg-ui/angular'

```    


Types of controls supported by High3DLinerChart:

 - title
 - xTitle
 - yTitle
 - chartId


 ## Quick Start
 
 we can create a high3DLineChart using the following tag: 

```
<ptg-ui-high-3d-line-chart
  [data]="data"
  [remainingOptions]="remainingOptions"
  title="LINE_CHART_3D"
  [categories]="categories"
  xTitle="Categories"
  yTitle="Values"
  chartId="chart-line-3d"
></ptg-ui-high-3d-line-chart>

```

Following are some controls with their explanation :

 1] title :

 The title appears at the top of the graph and should describe the graph. 

 This helps the reader immediately know what the graph is. 


<Canvas><Story id="component-high3dlinechartcomponent--title" /></Canvas>


2] xTitle : 


The axis title is a short text displayed alongside the axis. Usually, the axis title shows units of measurement for axis values, but you can put any text in it.

<Canvas><Story id="component-high3dlinechartcomponent--x-title" /></Canvas>



3] yTitle : 


The axis title is a short text displayed alongside the axis. Usually, the axis title shows units of measurement for axis values, but you can put any text in it.

<Canvas><Story id="component-high3dlinechartcomponent--y-title" /></Canvas>


4] chartId : 

The chartId attribute specifies a unique id for an chart . The value of the id attribute must be unique.

The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by other languages and manipulate the element with the specific id.
