 # High3DBarChart Component

 ---
 This chart is created using the Highcharts library. Highcharts provides a wide variety of charts.  

 Bar Chart is the most common chart type that is used to compare different categories of data like frequency, count, total, or average displayed in Horizontal bars. 

 We can import the High3DBarChart Component using the following importation : 

```
    import { ChartModule } from ' @ptg-ui/angular'
```


Types of controls supported by High3DBarChart:

 - title
 - xTitle
 - yTitle


 ## Quick Start
 
 we can create a high3DBarChart using the following tag: 

```
<ptg-ui-high-3d-bar-chart
  [data]="data"
  [remainingOptions]="remainingOptions"
  title="BAR_CHART_3D"
  [categories]="categories"
  xTitle="Categories"
  yTitle="Values"
></ptg-ui-high-3d-bar-chart>

```

Following are some controls with their explanation :

 1] title :

 The title appears at the top of the graph and should describe the graph. 

 This helps the reader immediately know what the graph is. 


<Canvas><Story id="component-high3dbarchartcomponent--title" /></Canvas>


2] xTitle : 


The axis title is a short text displayed alongside the axis. Usually, the axis title shows units of measurement for axis values, but you can put any text in it.

<Canvas><Story id="component-high3dbarchartcomponent--x-title" /></Canvas>



3] yTitle : 


The axis title is a short text displayed alongside the axis. Usually, the axis title shows units of measurement for axis values, but you can put any text in it.
