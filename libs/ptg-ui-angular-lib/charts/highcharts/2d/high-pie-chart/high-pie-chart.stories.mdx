Pie chart is a type of graph that represents the data in the circular graph.

Pie charts are divided into sections (or 'slices') to represent values of different sizes.


We can import the PieChart  using the following importation : 
```
    import { HighPieChartComponent } from ' @ptg-ui/angular'

```    


 
## Quick Start

we can create a piechart using the following tag: 

```
<ptg-ui-high-pie-chart [data]="data" [colors]="colors"></ptg-ui-high-pie-chart>
```
