 # LineBarChart Component

 ---

This chart is created using the Highcharts library. Highcharts provides a wide variety of charts.   

Bar-Line charts show two metric values aggregated across a group dimension. They are useful for showing quantity alongside changes in trends over time. 

Bar shows the rainfall in the month and line shows the temperature of the month.


We can import the Bar-Line chart component using the following importation : 
```
    import { ChartModule } from ' @ptg-ui/angular'

```    

Types of controls supported by Bar-Line chart:

 - title
 - subtitle



 ## Quick Start
 
 we can create a barline  graph using the following tag: 


```
<ptg-ui-linebar-chart
  [remainingOptions]="remainingOptions"
  title="my Charts"
  subtitle="Source: WorldClimate.com"
  [categories]="categories"
></ptg-ui-linebar-chart>

```


Following are some controls with their explanation :

1] title :

 The title appears at the top of the graph and should describe the graph. 

 This helps the reader immediately know what the graph is. 

<Canvas><Story id="component-linebarchartcomponent--title" /></Canvas>


2] subtitle : 

The subtitle of a piece of writing is a second title which is often longer and explains more than the main title. 

<Canvas><Story id="component-linebarchartcomponent--subtitle" /></Canvas>
