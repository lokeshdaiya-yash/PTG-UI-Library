 # BarChart Component

 ---
This chart is created using the D3 charts library. 

Of the available libraries, D3.js is one of the most popular. It allows you to create data visualizations by manipulating the DOM based on dynamic data.

Bar Chart is the most common chart type that is used to compare different categories of data like frequency, count, total, or average displayed in vertical bars. 

 We can import the BarChart  using the following importation : 
```
    import { BarChartComponent } from ' @ptg-ui/angular'

```    


 Types of controls supported by barChart:

 - height
 - width
 - margin
 - start
 - end

## Quick Start

we can create a barchart using the following HTML Tag: 

```
<ptg-ui-bar-chart
  [data]="data"
  [margin]="50"
  [width]="550"
  [height]="330"
  [start]="0"
  [end]="160000"
></ptg-ui-bar-chart>

```




Following are some controls with their explanation :

1] height :

height control sets the Chart height to any given value in Pixels.

If the height is not set for the chart container, it takes the default height.

<Canvas><Story id="component-barchartcomponent--height" /></Canvas>


2] width : 

width control sets the Chart width to any given value in Pixels.

If the Width is not set for the chart container, it takes the default width.

<Canvas><Story id="component-barchartcomponent--width" /></Canvas>


3] margin : 

The  margin conteol is used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.

<Canvas><Story id="component-barchartcomponent--margin" /></Canvas>



4] start : 

Start control is used to set the starting point of y-axis.

we can change the starting point of y-axis using the start control.

<Canvas><Story id="component-barchartcomponent--start" /></Canvas>


5] end :

end control is used to set the ending point of y-axis.

we can change the ending point of y-axis using the end control.

<Canvas><Story id="component-barchartcomponent--end" /></Canvas>
