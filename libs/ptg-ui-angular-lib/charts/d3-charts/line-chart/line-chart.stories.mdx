 # LineChart Component

 ---
This chart is created using the D3 charts library. 

Of the available libraries, D3.js is one of the most popular. It allows you to create data visualizations by manipulating the DOM based on dynamic data.

A line graph is a graphical representation of information that changes over a period of time.

You can plot it by using several points linked by straight lines. It comprises two axes called the “x-axis” and the “y-axis“.


We can import the LineChart  using the following importation : 
```
    import { LineChartComponent } from ' @ptg-ui/angular'

```    


 Types of controls supported by barChart:

 - height
 - width

## Quick Start

we can create a linechart using the following HTML Tag: 

```
<ptg-ui-line-chart
  [data]="data"
  [margin]="margin"
  [width]="860"
  [height]="400"
></ptg-ui-line-chart>

```



Following are some controls with their explanation :

1] height :

height control sets the Chart height to any given value in Pixels.

If the height is not set for the chart container, it takes the default height.

<Canvas><Story id="component-linechartcomponent--height" /></Canvas>


2] width : 

width control sets the Chart width to any given value in Pixels.

If the Width is not set for the chart container, it takes the default width.

<Canvas><Story id="component-linechartcomponent--width" /></Canvas>
