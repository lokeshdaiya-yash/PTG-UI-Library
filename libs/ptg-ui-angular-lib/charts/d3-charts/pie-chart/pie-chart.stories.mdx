 # PieChart Component

 ---
This chart is created using the D3 charts library. 

Of the available libraries, D3.js is one of the most popular. It allows you to create data visualizations by manipulating the DOM based on dynamic data.

Pie chart is a type of graph that represents the data in the circular graph.

Pie charts are divided into sections (or 'slices') to represent values of different sizes.


We can import the PieChart  using the following importation : 
```
    import { ChartModule } from ' @ptg-ui/angular'

```    


 Types of controls supported by barChart:

 - height
 - width
 - margin
 
 
## Quick Start

we can create a piechart using the following HTML Tag: 

```
<ptg-ui-pie-chart
  [data]="data"
  [margin]="50"
  [width]="750"
  [height]="600"
  [colorsArray]="colorsArray"
></ptg-ui-pie-chart>

```




Following are some controls with their explanation :

1] height :

height control sets the Chart height to any given value in Pixels.

If the height is not set for the chart container, it takes the default height.

<Canvas><Story id="component-piechartcomponent--height" /></Canvas>


2] width : 

width control sets the Chart width to any given value in Pixels.

If the Width is not set for the chart container, it takes the default width.

<Canvas><Story id="component-piechartcomponent--width" /></Canvas>


3] margin : 

The  margin conteol is used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.

<Canvas><Story id="component-piechartcomponent--margin" /></Canvas>
